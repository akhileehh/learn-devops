Installation
On Amazon Linux distributions
For those using Amazon Linux, the easiest way to install efs-utils is from Amazon's repositories:
``
$ sudo yum -y install amazon-efs-utils
``
on other distributions check https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mount-fs-auto-mount-update-fstab.html



To authenticate with EFS using the systemâ€™s IAM identity, add the iam option. This option requires the tls option.
$ sudo mount -t efs -o tls,iam file-system-id efs-mount-point/

To mount using an access point, use the accesspoint= option. This option requires the tls option. The access point must be in the "available" state before it can be used to mount EFS.
$ sudo mount -t efs -o tls,accesspoint=access-point-id file-system-id efs-mount-point/

To mount your file system automatically with any of the options above, you can add entries to /efs/fstab like:
file-system-id efs-mount-point efs _netdev,tls,iam,accesspoint=access-point-id 0 0

--make back up for img before mount
-- vi /etc/fstab   > copy it
--
