Installation
On Amazon Linux distributions
For those using Amazon Linux, the easiest way to install efs-utils is from Amazon's repositories:
``
$ sudo yum -y install amazon-efs-utils
``
on other distributions check https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mount-fs-auto-mount-update-fstab.html


Update the /etc/fstab file
Perform the following steps to update the /etc/fstab on an EC2 Linux instance so that the instance uses the EFS mount helper to automatically remount an EFS file system when the instance restarts.

To update the /etc/fstab file on your EC2 instance
Connect to your EC2 instance. For more information, see Connect to your EC2 instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

Open the /etc/fstab file in an editor.

For automatic mounting using either IAM authorization or an EFS access point:
To automatically mount with IAM authorization to an EC2 instance that has an instance profile, add the following line to the /etc/fstab file.
file-system-id:/ efs-mount-point efs _netdev,noresvport,tls,iam 0 0

To automatically mount with IAM authorization to a Linux instance using a credentials file, add the following line to the /etc/fstab file.
file-system-id:/ efs-mount-point efs _netdev,noresvport,tls,iam,awsprofile=namedprofile 0 0

To automatically mount a file system using an EFS access point, add the following line to the /etc/fstab file.
file-system-id:/ efs-mount-point efs _netdev,noresvport,tls,accesspoint=access-point-id 0 0

--make back up for img before mount
-- vi /etc/fstab   > copy it
--
